-General requirements

When passing invalid parameters for execution, the application should not crash.
Running without parameters displays instructions for using the program.
Parameters are passed in the order given in the job description.

-Envelope Analysis

There are two envelopes with sides (a,b) and (c,d) to determine if one envelope can be put inside the other. The program must handle the input of floating point numbers. The program asks the user for envelope sizes one parameter at a time. After each calculation, the program asks the user if he wants to continue. If the user answers “y” or “yes” (case insensitive), the program continues from the beginning, otherwise it terminates the execution.
